- Data Collection: Data was scraped from the GitHub API, filtering users in Dublin with over 50 followers and retrieving their most recent repositories.
- Key Insight: A significant portion of repositories are written in JavaScript, with TypeScript notably popular among users who joined after 2020.
- Actionable Recommendation: To boost visibility on GitHub, developers should keep a detailed bio, consistently update repositories, and mark profiles as open to hiring if relevant. Using popular languages like JavaScript and TypeScript can also attract followers, aligning with trends among highly-followed developers.

### Other Analysis
- There is a moderate positive correlation (0.555) between the number of followers and public repositories. Users with longer bios also tend to have more followers, suggesting detailed profiles may enhance visibility.
- Developers open to hiring are more likely to follow others, and those marked "hireable" share their emails slightly more often than others, potentially for increased networking.
